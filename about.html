    <h3>A synopsis</h3>
    <p>
        I'm just a nerd who liked playing video games, learned to upgrade computers and do basic networking to be able to play, and then was surprised to find out how valuable these skills, combined with an ability to self-educate, turned out to be. 

        I've spent a decade working full time in the IT world, first working with small and medium businesses as a freelancer, doing end user and internal support, and then in progressively and larger enterprise environments.

        I specialize in understanding networks, infrastructure, and perimeter security.  I love using infrastructure as code to help demistify the dark arts of infrastructure deployment and management.
